# Handy Docker images

This repository contains some handy Docker images for performing devops or deployment related tasks to be used with [SBT Native Packager](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager).

#### `openjdk-jre-8-bash`

This image can be used as the base image instead to reduce the image size.

```
dockerBaseImage := "fsat/openjdk-jre-8-bash:latest"
```

This image has significantly smaller size (`~ 100MB`) compared to `openjdk:latest` the default base image of specified by the SBT Native Packager (`~ 700MB`).

This image is based on `openjdk:8-jre-alpine` image with the following additional items installed:

* Bash
* Core utilities (i.e. `sed`, `awk`, and `ping`)
* Curl

Bash is required as the start script generated by SBT Native Packager requires Bash.

The core utilities and `curl` are added to facilitate troubleshooting during deployment.
